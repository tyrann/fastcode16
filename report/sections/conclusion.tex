In this project, we implemented a high performance Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange with C on an Intel CPU machine. It is proven by the experiments that the final optimization leads to better performance and faster execution time than the baseline. We also proposed a series of optimizing methods for large integer operations regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography and combinations of testing approaches. It has also been shown that the final combined optimization achieves better result than the naive approach. Funcion stitching and inline assembly gave us the most significant performance improvement. Moreover, the final optimization does make full use of the newest Intel ADX/BMI2 extensions.

Nevertheless, our approach is in general slightly behind the performance of OpenSSL. Certainly there is still room to improve in this implementation. Future works may include optimizing the program for a specific elliptic curve parameter set. AVX512 would also be an interesting benchmarking environment for our implementation.
