In this project, we implemented a high performance Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange in C on an Intel CPU machine. We proposed a series of optimization methods for multi-precision integer operations regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Function stitching and inline assembly gave us the most significant performance improvement. Whereas introducing Jacobian coordinates led to faster execution time because of its algorithmic improvements. Moreover, the final optimization does make full use of the newest Intel ADX/BMI2 extensions.

Nevertheless, our approach is close to the peak performance of the target machine and our implementation can compete with OpenSSL in terms of speed. Future works may include optimizing the program for a specific elliptic curve parameters' set. Investigating the potential improvement with the upcoming AVX512 would also be interesting.
