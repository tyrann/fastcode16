In this project, we improved the performance of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange with a C code implementation on an Intel CPU machine. It is proven by the experiments that the final optimization leads to better performance and faster execution time than the baseline. We also proposed a series of optimizing methods for large integer operations regarding Elliptic Curve Cryptography and combinations of testing approaches. It has also been shown that the final combined optimization achieves better result than the naive approach. Moreover, the final optimization does make the best use of Intel Intrinsics of the novel CPU model. 

Nevertheless, our approach is in general slightly behind the performance of OpenSSL and the form of private key will significantly influence the performance. Certainly there is still room to improve in this implementation. Execution time of larger key length set is one of the starting point. Since we use the base of 64 bits big integers, the total execution cycles are relatively high. Another significant limiting factor is the Montgomery multiplication, which is also the function that we are most behind compared with OpenSSL. Future work may include applying better shift algorithms and improving big integer structure.
