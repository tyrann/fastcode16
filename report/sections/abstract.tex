The increasing need of performance and speed in modern encryption requires more efficient implementations of known key-exchange algorithms. In this paper, we describe a fast implementation of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm on an Intel Skylake processor. In order to assess the performance and speed of our implementation, we run our code against the robust, well-maintained and extensively used \textit{OpenSSL} library.
