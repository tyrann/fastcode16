The increasing need of performance and speed in modern encryption requires more efficient implementations of known key-exchange algorithms. In this paper, we describe a fast implementation of the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm on an Intel Skylake processor. Intel ADX/BMI2 extensions are applied to optimize the code performance. In order to assess the performance and speed of our implementation, we run our code against the well-established reference library OpenSSL. In the end our implementation is competitive with OpenSSL in terms of speed.
